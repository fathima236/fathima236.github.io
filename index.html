                    <div style="color: #000;">
<p><big><font size="+2"> Dr. Kalpana Chawla was the first Indian woman in space. Born in India, she immigrated to the United States after earning her degree in aeronautical engineering. In the 1980s, she became a naturalized citizen and obtained her master’s and doctoral degrees in aerospace eineering. In 1994, NASA selected her as an astronaut candidate. Her first flight was in 1997 on the space shuttle Columbia, where she was an operator of the remote manipulator arm. Her second flight was in 2003 on Columbia, but when the shuttle re-entered Earth’s orbit for landing, part of the shuttle’s insulation broke off. This damaged the thermal protection system, causing hot gas to enter the wing and depressurizing the shuttle. All seven crew members died in the tragic accident. The crew’s legacy has been honored through documentaries and investigations to prevent future accidents. In 2010, the University of Texas dedicated a memorial to Chawla at the Arlington College of Engineering.</font></big></p>

               <h2 style="background-color:Cyan;">Early Childhood and Education </h2>

 <font size="+2"><p class="white-text">Born in the Indian city of Karnal in 1962, Chawla was the youngest of four siblings. Being confident and outgoing as she was known to be, she is said to have chosen her own name. At the time of her admission to a nearby school, she had not been given a formal name and was called by her nickname, Monto at home. As the principal asked Chawla to pick a name amongst the three names her family had in mind—Kalpana, Jyotsna and Sunaina. She happened to confidently pick ‘Kalpana’.<br><br>

Her interest in aeroplanes and flying had taken roots since her early childhood.  Karnal, being one of the few Indian towns at the time to have a flying club, would often see planes flying over, which Chawla had come to notice and enjoy watching. She was taken on a ride on the Pushpak and a glider by her father, an experience she fondly remembered.<br><br>

A confident, outgoing girl, Kalpana even selected her own name. It so happened that Kalpana had not been formally named at a proper ceremony and was called by her nickname “Monto” at home. During her admission in a nearby school, Tagore Bal Niketan, the principal asked the student’s name.<br><br>

Kalpana’s aunt replied that they had three names in mind – Kalpana, Jyotsna and Sunaina – but they hadn’t decided yet. So the principal asked the little girl which name she liked best. And she replied firmly, “Kalpana. Because it means imagination.”<br><br>

<p class="black-text" style=text-align:center;>
STS-87 Columbia (November 19 to December 5, 1997). STS-87 was the fourth U.S Microgravity Payload flight and focused on experiments designed to study how the weightless environment of space affects various physical processes, and on observations of the Sun's outer atmospheric layers. Two members of the crew performed an EVA (spacewalk) which featured the manual capture of a Spartan satellite, in addition to testing EVA tools and procedures for future Space Station assembly. STS-87 made 252 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.5 million miles in in 376 hours and 34 minutes.<br>

STS-107 Columbia (January 16 to February 1, 2003). The 16-day flight was a dedicated science and research mission. Working 24 hours a day, in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 80 experiments. The STS-107 mission ended abruptly on February 1, 2003 when Space Shuttle Columbia and the crew perished during entry, 16 minutes prior to scheduled landing.
